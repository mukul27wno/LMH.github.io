    <p>
        ExcelsiusGPS® Spine Surgery Robot is a next generation spine surgery robot which combines a rigid robotic arm and full navigation capabilities into <br>
        an adaptable platform for precise placement in spine surgery. Using ExcelsiusGPS® robotic navigation your surgeon can now place spinal implants with <br>
        high precision and accuracy than ever before.<br>

    <h3>FAQ'S</h3>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>1.What Happens During The Procedure?</h3>
    <p>
        Prior to the surgery, your surgeon will import your medical images into ExcelsiusGPS® to determine the size and placement of implant and a surgical <br>
        plan is created. This is further used to guide the rigid robotic arms to a particular region of the spine which is used as a pathway by your surgeon<br> 
        to accurately place the implants using instruments.<br>
        During the procedure, the robot guides your surgeon by displaying a live feedback on the screen and this ensures more precise placement of implant.<br>

    <h3>2.What Happens After The Procedure?</h3>
    <p>
        With the help of ExcelsiusGPS® Spine robotic navigation platform, minimally invasive procedure becomes more precise, minimal incision is required for <br>
        surgery and less blood loss. All this allows faster healing time and less discomfort to you. Though, recovery time varies from one patient to another, <br>
        however, within few weeks after your surgery, you will notice that your symptoms and pain are diminishing.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>3.How Is ExcelsiusGPS® Spine Surgery Robot Superior To Conventional Techniques?</h3>
    <p>
        The cutting-edge technology combines benefit of navigation and robotics into one platform to deliver patient care.<br>
        1.Multi-functional Robotic Navigation<br>
        2.Only robotic system that combines surgical navigation and robotic guidance for spinal surgery.<br>
        3.High degree of accuracy with small incision.<br>
        4.Faster and accurate placement of screw.<br>
        5.Imaging Versatility<br>
        6.Compatible with pre-operative CT, intra-operative CT and fluoroscopic imaging modalities.<br>
        7.Surgeon can visualize, plan and navigate patient’s anatomy in real-time.<br>
