    <p>
        The purpose of orthognathic surgery/ corrective jaw surgery is to correct functional and cosmetic problems that
        are due to underlying jaw deformities. <br>
        Orthognathic surgery is often the treatment solution in cases where the bite problem is so severe that
        orthodontic braces alone aren’t enough to correct <br>
        the problem or where orthodontics alone would compromise your facial appearance.<br>

    <h3>1.What exactly is an Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon?</h3>
    <p>
        Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (OMS) are specialists who treat conditions, injuries, and defects of the mouth,
        teeth, jaws, and face. Oral surgeons must complete<br>
        an additional 4 to 6 years of comprehensive training program after they graduate from dental school. Many oral
        surgeons attend programs that enable them to attend <br>
        medical school and obtain their medical degrees as well. Doctors Metz, Seidel and Orfanos have all completed
        their medical doctorates (MD)<br>
    </p>

    <h3>3.How do I determine if I am a candidate for dental implants?</h3>
    <p>
        Almost every person who is missing one or more teeth and is in good general health is a candidate for dental
        implant treatment. Working together with your primary care <br>
        physician, we can optimize treatment for patients with diseases such as diabetes so that they are candidates for
        dental implants. The quality and quantity of available bone <br>
        is an important factor in dental implant treatment. Oral Maxillofacial surgeons can, even with significant bone
        loss, perform extraordinary procedures that add bone or create<br>
        new bone allow people who would not otherwise have been candidates for dental implants to have successful
        implant treatment.<br>
