    <h3>1.Who Can Be A Donor For An Allogeneic Transplant?</h3>
    <p>
        Matching bone marrow is done by blood tests alone. It is not necessary to test the donor’s bone marrow at this
        stage.It is usual to start by testing<br>
        the brothers and sisters, as they are likely to provide the best match; parents are not usually good matches.The
        donor should be in good health. He or<br>
        she will be given a thorough medical checkup to make sure that there will be no risk to his or her own health
        from the procedure.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>2.Collecting Bone Marrow</h3>
    <p>
        About a week or two before the bone marrow harvest is done, the patient (or the donor, for an Allogeneic
        transplantation) may have 1 to 2 units of blood withdrawn.<br>
        This will be given back during the bone marrow harvest.The harvest itself is carried out under general
        anaesthesia, so one will feel nothing. It involves<br>
        the removal of some marrow from inside the bones at the back and front of the pelvis (the hip bones).The patient
        or donor will have to stay in hospital overnight <br>
        recover fully from the general anaesthesia. Usually it feels sore for a few days and mild painkillers may be
        required. These will be administered by the nurses or doctors.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>3.How Are The Stem Cells Collected?</h3>
    <p>
        Stem cell harvesting is done following a course of daily injections of a growth factor. This procedure takes
        about 3 hours. The patient will be made to lie down on a couch and <br>
        a transfusion will be put into the vein of each arm. Blood will be collected from one arm, into a machine called
        a centrifuge, which spins it to separate out the stem cells.<br>
        These are collected, and the remaining blood is returned through the IV in the other arm. The stem cells can
        even be frozen.<br>
