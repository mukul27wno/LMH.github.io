        <h3><u>Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair With MitraClip</u></h3>
    </center>
    <p>
        Mitral clip is a niche device to treat patients with severe mitral valve leak without open heart surgery. Our
        heart has four valves. These <br>
        valves regulate blood flow through the heart. The mitral valve which is on the left side of the heart controls
        blood flow from the atrium to <br>
        the ventricle. This valve has two leaflets that open and close within the heart ensuring that blood travels in
        only one direction.<br>

    <h3>1.Who Can Benefit From MitraClip?</h3>
    <p>
        1.A good alternative for patients who are not candidates for open heart surgery<br>
        2.An elderly patient or frail patient or a patient with a very weak heart<br>
        3.Patient with a history of any other non-cardiac conditions involving the lungs, kidneys or brain<br>
        4.Patients who previously underwent open heart surgery, due to higher risk for a re-operation<br>

    <h3>2.What are advantages of MitraClip?</h3>
    <p>
        1.Enables faster recovery<br>
        2.Reduction of hospital stay<br>
        3.Better quality of life<br>

    <h3>3.MitraClip trial outcomes?</h3>
    <p>
        The first successful human MitraClip implant was performed in 2003 in a 56 year old woman in Venezuela with
        reduction of severe mitral <br>
        regurgitation due to bileaflet prolapse to <2+ with concomitant clinical improvement5. After this first
            procedure, the MitraClip approach <br>
            to percutaneous mitral valve repair was evaluated in the United States in the Endovascular Valve
            Edge-to-Edge Repair Study (EVEREST) trials.<br>
