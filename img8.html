    <center><h3><u>Hip Arthroscopy</u></h3></center>
    <p>
        The frequency of Hip Arthroscopies has been increasing explosively over the past years, leading to a hugely improved technique and greater understanding<br>  
        of the arthroscopic anatomy of the hip joint. Arthroscopic hip procedures can successfully treat conditions previously unrecognized or only treatable by open<br>  
        procedures. Improvements in technology have made the procedure accessible and reproducible. Arthroscopy for intra-articular conditions and endoscopy for <br> 
        periarticular pathologies continue to evolve. With the increased understanding of hip pathology and the onset of new concepts such as femoroacetabular impingement,<br> 
        the need for an arthroscopic access not only to the central compartment of the hip but also to the periphery became evident.<br>

    <h3>1.How do I know if I have a hip problem?</h3>
    <p>
        The most common symptom in patients with hip disorders and labral tears is pain in the groin. Clicking or snapping in the groin may also occur. A bulging area in the<br>  
        groin is more likely to be hernia. Pain on the side of the hip is commonly related to trochanteric bursitis or gluteus medius tears. Pain in the buttock is generally <br> 
        related to the low back or sacroiliac (SI) joint but may be related to a hip problem.<br>

    <h3>2.How are hip disorders and labral tears diagnosed? </h3>
    <p>
        Hip disorders are evaluated by a thorough history (patient interview), physical exam, and appropriate imaging. Make an appointment to have your hip fully assessed.<br>
    </p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>3.What kind of imaging will I need?</h3>
    <p>
        The three types of imaging you may need are: 1) x-ray, 2) MRI, and 3) CT scan.<br>
        <b>X-ray</b> is the most common imaging modality we use and provides a good overview of the bony structure of the hip. Most patients will need to have x-rays taken <br>
        when they come in for an appointment. Even if you have had x-rays taken in the past, we may obtain additional specialized views to look for FAI.<br><br>
        <b>MRI</b> is an imaging technique that uses magnets instead of radiation in order to obtain detailed images of the body. MRI gives us the best look at the soft tissues<br> 
        (labrum, tendons, cartilage). We often obtain an MR arthrogram, a special type of MRI in which contrast fluid is injected into the joint, when a labral tear is suspected. <br>
        MRI is not performed in the office and requires an appointment. UC San Diego Health has several MRI machines so that most patients can schedule their MRI within a few days of <br>
        getting insurance approval.<br><br>
        <b>CT Scan</b> is the third type of imaging we use and provides a very detailed picture of the bony anatomy of the hip. This is particularly important in cases of complex FAI. <br>
        With the advanced imaging technology available at UC San Diego, we are able to create a 3-D map of your hip so that recontouring of the hip joint during surgery can be as accurate as possible.<br>
