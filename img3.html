    <p>
        You’ve just been diagnosed with a condition requiring surgery. Until very recently your options included
        traditional surgery with a large open <br>
        incision or laparoscopy, which uses small incisions but is typically limited to very simple procedures.<br><br>
        Thanks to a breakthrough in surgical technology, there is a new category of minimally invasive surgery for which
        you may be a candidate. It is an <br>
        effective, minimally invasive alternative to both open surgery and laparoscopy. Through the use of the da Vinci
        Surgical System, surgeons will now offer <br>
        a minimally invasive option for complex surgical procedures.<br><br>
        Imagine a major surgery performed through the smallest of incisions and encompassing the benefits of a
        definitive treatment with radically less pain, a<br>
        shorter hospital stay, faster recovery and return to normal activities.<br>
    </p>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>1.Is robotic surgery a “minimally invasive” procedure?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, robotic surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. A minimally invasive surgery uses small incisions
        rather than large ones or uses existing<br>
        entryways into the body. Laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery are both "minimally invasive." Generally,
        minimally invasive procedures cause less pain <br>
        and result in a faster recovery.<br>
    </p>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>2.How is robotic surgery different from more traditional minimally invasive surgical approaches available for
        patients?</h3>
    <p>
        During a standard laparoscopic procedure, your surgeon stands next to the operating room bed and utilizes
        hand-held instruments to perform your procedure. <br>
        This requires a series of small incisions. Using robotic technology, instead, your surgeon is seated at a
        console, using their own hands to maneuver the arms <br>
        and instruments of the da Vinci system. Again, this requires just a few small incisions. From that console, your
        surgeon has 3D vision and the ability to rotate <br>
        his or hands in angles and to degrees that would otherwise be impossible to achieve.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>3.What are the key patient benefits associated with undergoing robotic surgery?</h3>
    <p>
        Robotic surgery is safer and typically results in a number of key benefits for colorectal patients,
        including:<br>
        1.less blood loss<br>
        2.less pain after surgery<br>
        3.shorter hospital stay<br>
        4.quicker recovery<br>
        5.quicker return to work and normal life activities<br>
