    <h3>FAQ'S</h3>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>1.IS COSMETIC SURGERY SAFE?</h3>
    <p>
        For the overwhelming majority of cases the answer is yes, however, all cosmetic surgery, regardless of procedure entails an element of risk. A full <br>
        assessment of your current state of health, along with your medical history is made before surgery. All risks, no matter how remote are fully explained <br>
        to you prior to surgery.
    </p>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>2.IS COSMETIC SURGERY RIGHT FOR ME?</h3>
    <p>
        Three things must be kept in mind; your current state of health and medical history, desired outcome, and the motivation behind your decision. When you<br> 
        consult with a cosmetic surgeon at Apollo Cosmetic clinics , these factors will be fully determined and explored. At times a patient may believe a certain<br> 
        cosmetic surgery procedure is right for them, when in fact, alternatives exist that are more suitable and may not require surgery at all.<br>
    </p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>3.Can several cosmetic surgery procedures be performed at the same time?</h3>
    <p>
        It depends upon the procedures. Combining surgeries can save time and money and also provide your surgeon the opportunity to have the procedures “work in concert”<br> 
        with each other. However, do not assume this will always be the case. There are several important variables that must be considered. As with all patients, decisions<br>
        of this nature are always made on a case-by-case basis.<br>
