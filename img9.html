    <center><h3><u>Infertility Care</u></h3></center>
    <p>
        Before infertility testing, your doctor or clinic works to understand your sexual habits and may make recommendations to improve your chances of getting pregnant.<br> 
        In some infertile couples, no specific cause is found (unexplained infertility).Infertility evaluation can be expensive, and sometimes involves uncomfortable procedures.<br> 
        Some medical plans may not cover the cost of fertility treatment. Finally, there's no guarantee — even after all the testing and counseling — that you'll get pregnant.<br>

    <h3>2.What is In Vitro Fertilization?</h3>
    <p>
        In infertile couples where women have blocked or absent fallopian tubes, or where men have low sperm counts, in vitro fertilization (IVF) offers a chance <br>
        at parenthood to couples who until recently would have had no hope of having a "biologically related" child.<br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <h3>3.Does In Vitro Fertilization Work?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes. Since 1985, when we began counting, through 2017, 1,204,594 babies have been born in the United States as a result of reported Assisted Reproductive <br>
        Technology procedures (IVF, GIFT, ZIFT, and combination procedures).<br>
